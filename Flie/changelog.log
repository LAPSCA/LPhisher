1. I screwed it unintentionally in update 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3, 2.4 and 2.5 xD if you start it and it comes out that there is an actialization repetitively.
   Execute this command and it would be solved in its last version:
   
   
   cd .. && rm -rf LPhisher && git clone https://github.com/LAPSCA/LPhisher.git && cd LPhisher && python3 LPhisher.py
